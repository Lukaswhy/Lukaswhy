# Hey there

Windows-focused scripter working with **Python** and **JavaScript**.

I build custom Windows scripts with a **Linux-like, minimal style** — clean, simple, and functional. I create my own tools because I don’t like how many Windows apps look.

## About Me

Hi, I’m **Luca**, passionate about coding, scripting, and gaming. I run a **Discord server with a shop** and enjoy creating small tools to simplify Windows workflows. I love sharing my projects and helping others in the community.
