# Hey there

I'm **Lukas**, a beginner scripter working mainly with **Python** and **JavaScript**.

I create scripts **for Windows (Windows 11)**, but with a **Linux-like style** — clean, minimal, and simple. I started scripting because I don’t like how many Windows apps look, so I prefer building my own tools that feel closer to Linux apps in terms of design and usability.

I like the idea of Linux a lot, but since it’s not great for gaming, Windows is my main OS. My scripts run on Windows, but the design mindset is inspired by Linux.
